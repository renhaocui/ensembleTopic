Oh no, there's another Grogan floating in the kids pool
Don't get me wrong, we love cruising, going on our 3rd in April to Fiji, it was just really disappointing to go to the extra expense of a suite only to have the constant noise of chairs being dragged 
What if you leave from White Bay Passenger Terminal.long walk from Central.
Margaret yes the meals may be small but remember you can order what ever you like as exstras to give you more
Cheryle, there's your sun lounge!!
On the pearl right now about to set sail for home <sob>. Great melbourne cup and a massive tick on the bucket list. Great job P&O everything was fantastic!
I do prefer the old logo (with the sun setting), than the current one which is just the P&O part of it.
Stepping back on board after visiting yet another beautiful island knowing a bountiful meal is all prepared for us.

Such a great idea. There was nothing worse then breathing in second hand smoke when watching a movie or eating outside as their isn't always room inside. Good for you p&o
Just post on trip advisor and other travel forums till someone answers. P&O will just look bad because we have to work so hard to get what could have been a simple answer!Same goes for massage and

We paid about $400 travel insurance and it does not cover first $100 per personSo we did get cheap insurance
Such a shame Leigh! I really hope &O can sort it out! retty pathetic for you to try so many avenues to get it sorted!
Ok thanks a lot for your help
regardless I think that you would most likely buy and take your own. can not always rely on what some one else has said.
P&O could put in some sort of chair lift that could swing out and lower a disabled person into the pool. Shouldn't be too hard to do or organize I wouldn't think.
We have fix the problem
I have had this on many cruises - cabins can be allocated right up to the day of boarding - don't worry, you will get a cabin. All the cabins (in the same class) are basically the same anyway.
Thank you for a great Australia Day aboard the Pacific JewelLooking forward to Australia Day 2016
We met an awesome family on our cruise in 2010. Linda Lamp, Bryson Bain & Andrew Cunningham, did another cruise with them last year.
Thanks for that Cheryl. There is always talk about car parks and such and just couldn't remember and we wondered if it would be better to get dropped at Central and then get a taxi, but now he can tak

I'm sure we will be running a muck just like that.

Quick question, if you book a twin room and then get upgraded, do they upgrade you to a twin again.if not, I might have a few awkward friends on my trip!!!
In Brisbane you can check luggage in at 8.00am onwards so that could be possible at white bay, that way you can leave and come back later.
Yes. As long as there is one original passenger is still in the cabin. Just be aware if changing an adult for an under 16 that the kids quota isn't full.

On our previous P&O cruises we have had Rugby League games shown on the Big Screen Sat, Sun and Mon. Please tell me this will be the case on J520 (South East Asia Explorer) 10th May.
When do you get home Tania? Don't think bub will be here within the next 3 days

The way Jenny was treated, being pushed into cancelling, & no option to rebook? That is P&Os fault.
Well looks like we picked the right travel agent. Too busy to talk when I went in there and no phone call as promised. Lets see how much longer this goes on for. Been well over a week now.
Thanks for getting back to me, it's much appreciated. Just do not understand why there is events for much later cruises that mine. But thanks anyway
I received this today. I also checked my email to ensure that I had not missed the email and I had nothing on file. It maybe an idea that you put a read receipt on emails in future.

Hi Chris, sorry, its a little hard to understand what you are asking - are you talking about credit card authorisations or the 1.5% fee for paying by card (or both) ?
and this is why the policy on drinks has been changed because of these people.

Was I the only one who noticed.that P&O Cruises Australia, only answered half of Jayme-Lee's question? she asked what happens in bad weather when Deck 14 and Deck 7 are closed.
Dinner at the Salt Grill .
Glad to join the club just booked my 4th cruise
If the account has been settled this should not happen. Cash, cash, cash.
Yes please!! 
If you want 5 star quality you need to pay 5 star prices so not sure what you were expecting? P&O are generally regarded as being 3-star ships in the cruise world. Kids club and babysitting is clear
i dont smoke, but wouldnt other ship lines have the same problems with areas being closed off due to weather and smokers having nowhere to smoke
Makes it kinda desperate and sad that it's come to this really. I've heard of people just having it in their jackets as they walk on, same after shore tours, especially Villa, no one Pats u down, but
Thank you so much. This would be fantastic if this could happen for my partner it would make her birthday so special.

It needs to be attended to immediately. I was dealing with Aubrey but can no longer contact her as her mail box is full. I will pm you all the details now.
Sandboarding on Moreton Island was fun!
Wala. Beautiful residents there.
the excitment is building, have a great cruise and enjoy the ship, destinations and new friends you all will make.
Lower deck doesnt mean cheaper cabin, it be the same category just lower down.
There are cups and glasses supplied, so if you use those you can then fill your own bottle if you need to. You are not allowed to use your bottle under the dispensers as it is a health risk.
182 comments with majority supporting P & O decision!Congratulations to P & O for enforcing your duty of care.

of course not (I should have said disappointed, not upset lol) , safety first, but yes p&o should take it off their shore tours so people are not continuing to book it :)
when I booked on the invoice doesn't have those letters but my Mum doesn't have a middle name so would they just assume that means no middle name and just let it pass?
You smell too.your comment reeks of dumdASS
Lets hope that there is not more to the story and goes well
Hi can you have a look at my cruise control as its not showing that i have paid all my cruise. Can u fix please. Cruise number is 7KWG8D. Thanks.

Good to see turf around the pool. The ships are so dangerous with slippery surfaces around all their pools . Have seen many accidents on my many cruises, because of this.
The bank told me P&O took the money out twice and it had nothing to do with a hold.
Port Douglas, weather was beautiful.

A plane is not an open air situation, it is enclosed. It also lasts for (at the absolute most if you're travelling to the other side of the world) a day, not 7-14 days.
On the day the ship returns to home port at 6am, do you need to be ready to disembark at 6am or do you have until a certain time to check out?

It's a beautiful area Just gorgeous
Which ship?
Yes they are good. The prices depends on the photo and package - I think the boarding photo is $40 for the set and from memory each print is about $20.
Saw the Pearl the other day. Died a little inside knowing I wasn't on it.
I liked eating all the pussy

Pacific Dawn, the best part of the cruise to any bootiful island :-)
Who is your travel agent ?? Never have i seen an obstructed view cabin cost more than deck 5 even if it is the front or back of the ship. I do all the research for our cruises by cost and room selecti

We are on the maiden voyages for both of the new ships :)
I went on your NYE cruise on the Pearl and was told by your staff. 'Do not book a cruise in school holidays if you don't want kids in the adults pool'. I did put a comment while on board and when we

The shittest holiday me and my partner have ever been on
I was on the Pacific Jewel end of Jan through Feb 7th last year 2014 with family celebrating a 50th wedding anniversary. It was a great holiday with so much to do and great food and service. Loads of 
James Buster was outstanding as was the 'Life as we Know It show on the Pacific Dawn.
Fare for a single is one adult fare then approx 70%of another single try to find someone but if can't will have a ball
Need to start planning Something to look forward too

We started on the pacific sun just before she was sold and the pacific dawn in 2013 we love it and will be cruislings again soon.
In Port Denaru - Do the Resorts on the Bulla Bus. In Suva, definitely do a P&O tour (for your safety), and I would suggest a highlights type tour.
Triple ship day isn't it ????

We will be seeing you again on the pearl in october 2015 and we cant wait.
Sheryl and Tania.look, we will be here in a month and a half :)
Fun for the whole family! <URL>
Not all of us are rich Wanda Woolidge and I have Been promised the cheque at least 5 times. I think you'd be betting annoyed after 11 weeks!
Do you really think ranting every day on Facebook will get it sorted !
In the US they now have completely smoke free ships
I have read lots of comments about the disgusting smell of smoke and how everyone is fed up about it, well I hate the smell of farts so should we ban that too and make it only allowed on deck 7 lol
i wish it was just about cabin location, it's more about the way I was treated by 2 of their staff members
Someone i carnt say and i will sit back and enjoy lol
I was getting off and u were getting on! I did enjoy the cruise but need another to get over the stress when dealing with the aftermath!!!!!
Love it.can't wait to cruise on the Jewel again next year 
My partner and I have enjoyed 2 cruises now. First one was to Fiji in 2013 and recentlyNew Zealand in 2014. Was wanting to try Papua New Guinea this year. Haas anyone gone there? What were your opin

Relaxing on my cruise in 17 days
All of the other Cruise line I have Cruised with allow Wine to be taken on board . P&O don't . I think they have even restricted the amount of water and soft drinks you can take on as well .
makes you wonder.it better be worth while as that will be my only P&O cruise.
Maybe I should call P&O direct. I see they have suites available for only a few hundred more than what I paid. I would happily pay more to get that sort of upgrade, which is why I cannot understand 
Mare, the water was so clear & you only had a short swim for some spectacular coral & fish, the people were very friendly as well.

But as a non smoker you can go anywhere on the ship and not smoke. Smokers however are only allowed to smoke on certain parts of the ship yet we pay the same price for our trip
Thats good to hear
Please take me here David Doak 
Thankyou for you quick response and clearing that up for me
Agreed. Given it was an international cruise departing that day, you can't 'call in a few days to decide what to do'. If you don't board the ship, you basically forfeit your fare unless you are able

Absolutely loved my trip to Sydney. 2 nights definitely not long enough. My14 day trip to n.z. will be awesome.
The point is P&O have actually done an illegal thing by serving him that many drinks that night, what if he went overboard due to being served this amount, they would be in a hell of a lot of trouble 
Oh man they were the days! Hahahaha. I will never forget that trip 
Not good hope it gets sorted for you soon.

I beg to differ, I regret cruising on the pacific pearl. It was not a pleasant experience.
Trust they instigate that no smoking rule across all P&O fleet as at moment many open areas effected by the minority of smokers polluting air for all passengers and crew.

Eyes closed and fingers crossed.
And alot of smokers were fine with the change also Paul Hayes - its not about winning. its about being healthy and happy in a family environment!
The cruise itself will no doubt be amazing, just not the customer service and communication which is a big thing, my mum loves the cruises!

I don't get it, if you wre in isolation for 24 hours how did they put you off the ship????? surely the ship had already sailed. I think it was more than just travel sickness
That's because it was DUCK tape, silly Kerrie 
Thank you so much for answering
Rachael Lonsdale, you should do this next year!
You can take an empty sports drink bottle and fill it onboard at any of the water stations, or straight from the tap in your cabin.
YES yes.my 70th was such a HAPPY occassion.I want to do again.soon
could be a scam because they dont have an alcohol package and food is included in the fare
Love the new live chat feature on cruise control just had a lovely chat with Roselle.

I don't drink but I do smoke. I don't winge and carry on like you Lyndon. I would love it if they banned alcohol. How would you feel if I said ' we don't need piss heads on our cruises'.
We cruised to Fiji early April last year. Was beautiful and warm during the day, a little cooler on deck at night, where you may need a light jumper. Air con can get cool in some parts of the ship

YAY roll on the 19th of April 2015 !!
my wish has come true. We will be sailing with the Jewel on 28th January. Maybe the only thing that could be better is a Christmas cruise. Next time maybe.
I already had it sorted out today. Only after spending 40minutes on the phone and then still having errors with passenger details which I had to then get fixed up again. Not a good experience at all.
Omg u couldnt vacate room by 11.30, wat would u have done if the ship had been on time
How do I book to get on the dawn looks fantastic P&O
How could you possibly be bored on a cruise?
I love this whole cruiseling concept. I saw a billboard on the way to work which read be free earthlings & a cruise ship behind. Certainly bought a smile to my face as I am definitely a cruiseling! 
When I step on Pacific Sun for the first time ! that was it.13 cruises later !!
I just don't understand how you can have a cruise for sale (April 2013) and not have Shore Tours organized at the same time!
Our cruise on the jewel last night coming into sydney hit 120km winds and 12m swell was kinda fun. First cruise never felt unsafe at any stage

Yes, Sharon just informed me that you are able to do that, I had absolutely no idea you could. I'm so doing it for next year. :)
if they that worried about it why is the 18plus area non smoking make that smoking and also if they going to stop smoking on deck 12 they should also ban alcohol up there as well as children shouldn't

Still no shade option for the pool. With skin cancer so prevalent amongst Australians (your major market) I would have thought this would have finally been addressed. SHAME !!!!
I want that cocktail lol
Sounds like a good idea. P&O Jewel is similar.
Champagne Bay is the prettiest place I have been to, it's just a island paradise without any of the other rubbish and untouched

Great review good to read a positive post Marg.
Next year we doing 4 nights in singapore, then 16 nights cruise back to brisbane, so 20 nights all up. pretty good.
I think it has to do with the hertz onboard. However my straightener says 50-60 hertz so it would be fine with the higher voltage.

Looks nice. I went on the Jewel and it was glorious. My daughter went on the Dawn and said she loved it, pool and all. Keep up the good work P&O.
So I have decided not to cruise with P&O or Princess again. It's sad as I like P&O but they don't look after the guests like RCI or Celebrity.
where do you get written proof from ? the booking confirmation doesn't show it. its definitely in the printed brochure from P&O Cruises Australia

well, they have always had smoking on deck 14 outside dome. just more will be smoking up there now. and of course, we knew that the complaints would start from those using jogging track
so are they the same as a normal pub then?
Good work people who want to smoke it's there choice I don't want my kids exposed to that !!
I hope you are looking at an alternative spot for us that is just as comfortable not just to stop smoking full stop! We smokers spend a lot of money on deck 12

Booked through the ship. Have done it twice now once around the beaches and just in January we went to Forrest Park.poured with rain that day but was still great fun
Id say its tender. as there isnt a big wharf on mornington peninsula to dock at. so not sure where tenders go to.
Lifou went one December the island was covered in butterflies was like something out of a movie. Also Airlie beach was gorgeous.

It was due to the extreme wind down the river, if we had gone whilst the wind was blowing towards us, we probably would've had trouble getting under the bridge. The cruise itself was great! Best ship

Does anyone know whether you can only see them on P&O official shore tours and how much walking is involved (My wife has some mobility issues)
Great friends on a perfect cruise <URL>
Yes, it was the begining if Sept. sigh. 6 months tomorrow. woohoo!
Thanks for getting back to me. I'd read the answer on the event page but this has cleared up my only remaining question.
We are there sweetheart bring it on 14 nights yaaaaaay xx
Is the ship stay overnight in Adelaide, if so, I think you can do it, but check with the ship security first. The Pacific Sun used to stay overnight in Cairns and people did it when it stayed overnig

No one asks for something like this and no one deserves to loose that amount of money when they just loose someone they love and just before Christmas to even more add to their grief.
Turtle meat arseholes!
I've been reading these comments and some of them amaze me. The way some people think is mind blowing.

I am sad still no room number on my cruise 12th march on pearl.hope I get it soon.but cannot wait to b back on the beautiful pearl again xxx
Thanks heap for this you guys rock in cruising
You're so wrong. Smoking IS forced down everyone's throats. That's just the point.
Cruise number 14 embarking on the 27th Jan 15. Counting down can't wait
When i got of my first cruise now im hooked cant stop cruising
We made a massive leap in life by emigrating from the UK to New Zealand. Within 2 weeks of being here we knew we had made the right decision for us and especially for our daughter. In 2012 we cruised 
I agree with you Liz Wood. they wouldnt run the tenders at Isle of Pines when we were there. said to rough. & in my experience the manner of transfer is very stable,not at all like planks. 
Hi P&O! Will you be putting pictures up of the dawn in dry dock / videos like you did last time? I'm on the first cruise out of Brisbane after the dry dock! Thanks :-)
Mine did same as Geoff Matthews all good if you log onto computer.
Wish oasis was bigger like serenity on carnival ships.
The booking numbers are 6L9VVQ,6L9VGG,6L9VGC,GL9VVWIts been a drama from the get go. I have list of employees I spoke to. The first booked us on wrong cruise twin share instead of quad share and ha

Bev Drew Susan Hall Aaronn James Gordon Justin Fed Marge Gordon
Chelsea Hodder the squirt squad haha
I pay the same for a G & T or Beam and Coke on the ship, as I do at our local pub. Also cocktails are way cheaper than land based bars.
On the jewel loved it
Yes looking forward to a stress free brake right here in just over 100 days, bring it on!!!!!

Also wish they would do an Auckland to Auckland cruise via Australia.
Are there clocks in the rooms in the pacific jewel
Indeed, love the cruising community! This has helped decide that our daughters 16th birthday celebration will be spent cruising.
Common sense must prevail then judy. clearly. if there is a storm. smokers are gonna have to suck it up (excuse the pun) until the storm passes. it wont kill them! And its you're* jayme.
I have never had a driver in Vila who was anything but honest. They drive badly but I have not been ripped off in any case
Looks good Stacey
Michelle seems like the TA didn't tick the box for no upgrade you may not find out cabin number to boarding try not to stress to much
Can you spot your mum Julie Mewett? Bet she is having a great time.
I've picked a check in time for fiji cruise for 10-1030. Does this mean you also have to board at this time?
Going on our first ever cruise in September then our second cruise in November. We love cruising so much we have booked another one for 2016
Thank you. I have only ever been on cruises to the South Pacific.
The moment I stepped on the ship!
Correct Cheryl, was on the Pearl in January and the grill included lunch without charge, was back on her in September and lunch was no longer included in the fare (only breakfast). No other changes we
I had to cancel mine 3 weeks before my cruise, I got a refund from P&O and from my Insurance.
at home i'm busy, on a cruise lazing aound and loving it
Glad to hear that none of these ships are in for a rough ride.
Could you tell me the best transport to get to white bay theres 38 of us from darling harbour
This is my favourite part of the ship to sit and watch the wake.
OK so i got the date wrong it wasn't christmas , close to it tho and i DID get the company right . <URL>
my first step on board :) just love cruising
The Oasis on the Pearl, cocktails, spa , sunset. nothing better. 26 days to go
There is still laws and rules you need to follow. im not 'picking' on smokers. just agreeing with P&O's decision!

We have made friends we will keep forever xx
If you relegate one fifth of your cruising population to a small, segregated and insufficient area of your ship, you've got to expect a bit of backlash.
I do understand their policy though, and I'm sure there will be other parents in the same boat too ;)
Hey Lloyd.Im on that cruise with ya. !! Me and the squeeze and daughter. catch up for cocktails at sail away ay ?
Thank u soo much! That's awsum :)
Cant wait til 27 june going on a cruise with my cousin 10 days of bliss
Wankers and fat people should be banned from 12 too. Afterall that's a choice!
We are staying onboard also because only those doing the tour are allowed ashore, and if you have your monthlies and you go on the tour you have to tell the guide as you have to stay along side him.
Chistine I was thinking of pearl has turtle cove pool too
Fair enough. Maybe you need to do a formal complaint. But seriously? Complaining about TV on a cruise ship 
yes, this could actually mean we will rethink our cruise next year

Yes please Sarah Byron and Emma Byron, just the dispenser with straw.hold the glass!!!
upgrades seem to be over rated anyway - you are lead to believe you are getting a better cabin but, as other travelers found last year, it might be a balcony cabin but will be where all the noise is

I have the best time of my life doing this cruise last year can't wait u until I do another one.
Awesome, thank you!
I love to drink still and I gave up smoking 6 years ago .I enjoy it more and actually buy more expensive drinks as I have more money since giving up ciggies

I will luv it barbara,and if one wishes to pay for a mini suite its there option;-)u are NOT a show off:-)
Thanks P&O Cruises Australia - great decision. definitely a step in the right direction :-)
You mean to say you need an excuse to go cruising?
what's your problem? this is very vague.
Hey Anna! I did actually point out that I thought children were 12 and under but she told me that was not the case. Perhaps I looked at the wrong thing :P. I will give it another go tomorrow and hope 
It does take a day (or more) for the agent to send the money to P&O and cruise control update - not all travel agents are as diligent (quick) as some.
And its not JUST put.this happened ages ago.the bad ones ruin it for the good ones.story of life i'm afraid
 I love #Tamania. Been there 2x. #ttot #sbtc #travel

Thanks for the false advertising P&O
Christie, so very true.

if its the same one i read someone was being kicked off for peeing on deck 14, they did the wrong thing and got caught

Unfortunately I don't believe they are kept.
Either P&O customer service is slipping or more dissatisfied cruisers get better response by posting on here.

Agree that 1 in 5 people smoke, but unless they are all smoking 24 hours a day there won't be 400 people there at the same time. That's a bit like saying there needs to be 2000 toilets on the ship. PS

I believe the changes will be good. have recently sailed with another cruise line who has these food stations in their casual dining area and it is great.

Ahhh, so smokers are the only ones with dirty, filthy habits? Just anothre example of the holier than thou attitude of a lot of non smokers. Superior and better than the poor smokers are you?
How about P&O cruises refund ALL of the money I've paid ?? when I cancelled I was advised 5 business days. 25 days I get a payment of $300 charged back to my CC. I'm still waiting for the balance. 
P&O Cruises Australia should be able to give you the correct answer to this.

Yes a suite does cost that much and well worth it, where do you find a mini suite for that much on a 14 day cruise?
Brilliant idea - and with well over 500 likes. clearly this is the right direction to take! Ignore the smoking haters P & O :-)

Here is the pre canvas shot , just big enough for a tent / BBQ and maybe two deck chairs . My retirement home :-)
i had no issues at all on the dawn
Awesome crew + cold Heineken + luna thai  31 days to go!
The ski club sounds like a plan, lol
yep its quite funny when people say they will change companies over such a pittance of a thing, maybe they are the people who dont enjoy holidays without drama lol
Some people get sea sick on smaller vessels, but are surprised when they go on a large ship, Make sure you have travel insurance and if you do still feel sick after trying over the counter medication,

Wow, what's wrong with keeping the designated smoking area on one side? Win, win for both the smokers and the non-smokers? One day the world will band smoking everywhere so then everyone will have to 
Me too Kerrie, funny, The Pearl and the Jewel have the same area on deck 12 as a smoking area. So now we get shoved to the area where there is a walking/jogging track to annoy those passengers!!

I've paid in full Casey, and still can't book for Indonesia, and no tours showing for the other ports. Hopefully soon. So, no, it has nothing to do with you not paying in full yet :)

Exactly 12 months today!

You can take pretty much anything EXCEPT : irons, kettles, toasters, and bottles of water/alcohol/soft drinks and poppers. You CAN take on 12 cans of soft drink per person.
Its on my bucket list
does anyone know if they take solo passengers i cant find anyone interested in going on a cruise to share with
I went on all the adventures. Great!
next thing they will want to keep the drinkers in one area, then push them aside too. its all well and good when they want the sales from the smokes and alcohol though.
Well said Ashley.Yes only 1/4 of the deck is allocated to smokers.
That's fine with all due respect I've waited since last Thursday more time won't hurt.
Thank you for the reply P&O :)

We will get to see this in january. You will have to wait a little longer Amie.
there is no alcohol or soft drink packages on any P&O cruise from australian waters, but you will be able to purchase a mocktail pack that gives you 6 drinks for the price of 4 at around $20.00.
#pocruises even blocked purchase card so the person has no way of purchasing non alcoholic liquids in any form. WTF
Can we go back now Michelle Leak
I think it's disgusting that I have to put up with any smoking on board a ship that I can't leave - way to take away my right to have my health :)

Sorry, but you asked twice if there was 'any way around the rule' which does honestly sound like you're asking for special treatment. This is a public forum and P&O don't monitor it 24/7 so we all an

Addicted to cruising. Love P&O. Definitely NOT a cruiseling - I thjnk it's a ridiculous concept & it suggests lemming-like creatures blindly following along without uniqueness or individuality.
Salt snd grill but what was very yummy was plain fish chips served in chippy metal baskets we all loved it

Just got of pacific dawn worst cruise ever never on that one again
Please don't stop the music
Same as on the Pacific Dawn. Seems P&O may have a lot of problems with their staff, or is it the senior management?
We're booked in for the Ultimate New Guinea Islands cruise in 2016!
Bruce said one of the ladies who at CGU at mfield said she is going on our cruise too.
She got her answer from P&O. How immature are some people to not realise they have been given their answer. I have not been nasty. She just can not accept it is her own fault and no one elses.
I think its more the standards of ethics and communication he is more disappointed in than the way the money will be or is returned to him
Shellie Bennett look what ypu are missing out on.
Very well said . What happens when the zea is rough and winds so strong they lock off the deck . 7 i am talking bout what happens there . I will find a hidey hole lol to have me smoke lol

How did you manage to board, I have known the boarding process can take over a hour and that is in the queues for boarding pass, custom check then security check once on the ship.
I was told she would call me back. She wanted to raise the issues with her team meeting and call me to tell me why I was charged and about compensation?

We haven't been able to book the tours yet as we are still 90 days out. So yes, unless P&O have stuffed up with the current prices, these obscene mark-ups will apply :(

Be wary of Garath Ruhe, Cheryl Gatt, Jeanette Winsbury and Tom Fitzgerald. Collectively they run some P&O fb forums and they are scary threatening people as a group. One is a known stalker.

It is not a duty free cruise. The ship must leave Australian waters to qualify as duty free.
Still waiting to hear from her. Went in today but they were too busy so nope still waiting.

Danny Black is the best performer ever , his show in the Orient Bar was awesome . My sister and I were there every night of our 10 day cruise , best cruise ever on the Pearl .
I think this is more about P&O protecting there new investment on deck 12. not peoples health. New carpets, deck chairs, Furniture etc. ????
Aquaaerobics (not too early though). Jam session/open mic for musicians. Information session/video on coral reefs and how fragile they are. (see too many people walking on coral etc )

Hi there, We are going on a cruise on the Pacific Pearl and just wondering about the carry on soft drink cans. Are the 12 loosely packed cans per person to be in checked luggage or just carry on? 
to be back on that bloody boat again
And what a great town it was .as my hipusbaand is limited with walking didn't book a shore tour .did an hour taxi ride and had one of the best taxi drivers that we have ever had was a great trip
8 sleeps to go, can't wait !!
For the sydney to Moreton island cruise do we just need a valid Australian drivers licence at checkin or is a passport required?
You can see on the price list I just posted its $20 for 1 turn on flying fox, no way would it have jumped up in price to $59 for 1 turn.
Big listMichelle Harvey Cherilee Cotton Michelle Holland Cindy Tarrant and so many more. some i have even cruised with a second time xxx

Fantastic way to travel.

Thanks for that. Great customer service 
We are going on Voyager of the seas that will leave the next day but we are going to the pacific islands 
Bad service and the food was ordinary. Definitely not the standard I have experienced before
I love pacific dawn but all the p&o staff are lovely on all the ships but dawn is my favorite :)
It's a while since I've hired. But yes it's about $55 to hire the set for the duration of the cruise. But you do get to keep the snorkel part and give back the flippers and mask.
Just found out the ship is late in but we book the bus from central at 12 pm what happens to that time

i wont one but teeth first i think.
i don't think ppl have a negative with children some of the ppl on here that smoke take kids cruising as well
All day every day and only change to go to the connection bar after dinner then maybe just a stroll around the oasis again before bed
Or maybe the family realised P&O had a case and they took it down? Who knows?
Cans must be taken on as carry on luggage and packed loosely
 We'd love it if your cruise guests would share their pictures with us on our website via pics.com.
I was assaulted on my last cruise by a crew member, never again
P&O Cruises Australia, your passengers have a right to know about whether or not the smoking rules have changed, it could make a difference who we all choose to cruise with, you have a huge amount of

They might also gain some - companies don't tend to ban things if it will impact their bottom line.

Well it's a lesson learned then, isn't it? Never scrimp on travel insurance. Every other cruise line has the same T&C's.

Now I am confused , are you saying that if I charge my phone or use my straightner it won't work or will damage my items ?
When a waiter brought me a drink while I sat in one of those round comfy deck beds for 2 while watching the wake of the water at the back of the ship.

That's my pose hey Carmen Simpson! Copy cats.
You should try a Princess cruise. Much nicer ships and hardly any young kids .
Yeh but if they did that, they wouldn't make a good profit. They are a missive company and they have a massive staff so we just have to except it. They reduce the price closer to the sail date to fill
Yes it was .we got the hop on hop off bus .bought the tickets at the cruise terminal. And it included a two for one pint at this restaurant, so we stayed for lunch and the food was great
Wow so impressed!!!Thank you P&O for calling me to arrange the birthday cake etc. Exceptional service. I can't wait to sail!!!!! Thank you again.

Layla, you will find that a cabin on deck 5 is much smoother than a cabin on deck 8. Unless your travel agent ticked the box saying 'no upgrade'
There is only one port where you dock, and that is very primative. The town is very unfriendly, and the ship charges an arm and a leg for the shuttle. If you travel, you are better of getting a taxi
3 weeks tomorrow for our 18th P&O cruise. It's on the beautiful Jewel and as usual, we can't wait.

Savu Savu in Fiji. The locals are so friendly and the atmosphere is of the place is so fun. Really good markets as well.
Unfortunately you smokers cannot control or contain the toxic poison you exhale.even on an open deck!

maybe you should have found a seat in the non smoking section on deck 7

Awesome day at Lifou Tuesday 16th. Pacific Dawn. The cruise was awesome. My first. Food was great. We went to all restaurants. So much variety. Different every day. Loved the high tea at Luke Mangan

Use the hand sanitizers at all food counters. Wash hands after using the rest rooms and use the paper toweling provided in the deck rest rooms to open the door to leave. Avoid using the hand rails.

Met some of your tradies at Frisco's #wooloomooloo two weekends ago. Great guys doing a great job.
I suspect there will be lots of things on these new ships that will be worked out closer to the day.
My husband is an ex service man and as we will be on our cruise on ANZAC day on the Pacific Dawn will there be a service on board?
Really Jason? If you are the sort of non smoking person P&O want on their cruise ships then good luck to them.
I left there yesterday! If you want a local guide that's good fun and value ask for George of the jungle! Great guy! Cascades was amazing!!!!

We had very similar problems, but I must admit when I went over in the middle of the night and asked them to be quiet they did
Agree Katherine, just come back off cruise with friend and ship was nowhere near full. Think they would rather have 1 fare than empty cabins.
Whatever its still enclosed space. And Erin youre disgusting.
Cause it's expensive and they don't want to advertise it so that we can be offended. But we got no choice if we want it when we see it. Once captive 'if you book them they will come'.

No butts about this new plan
This happened to my hubby's on our last cruise on the Jewel too :/
Those pizzas are sooooo delicious though haha
Good video's Daniel, must have taken some time to put all that together.
Hi P&O - I read somewhere that the burgers etc at the grill are no longer free and there is a cost involved. Is this true? I have checked the website and it still says the grill is free until after 5.

Great news! Can't wait for my next cruise
Where are the terms and conditions and details about the prize. I entered and looked all over the site and cannot find a link to them anywhere.
Just thought it was very disappointing that my mates have never cruised with P&O and they got an upgrade and I didn't and I'm the loyal guest :(
They do have some fantastic staff on board and had a gr8 time them.
Can anyone tell me if you still get duty free on a cruise that goes from syd to adelaide?
If you want a drink after paying to get on the boat it will cost the same as a hole bottle .

Thats unfortunate, but 4 berth cabins are two sets of bunks. this should have been clearly pointed out to you when booking.

They can enjoy deck 12 EXACTLY like the non smokers by enjoying it without smoking.

P&O provide a Tender (small boat) to take you from the ship to the Islands and there you are on the beach.
Wondering when you will enjoy the new Deck 12 master duffy. Your name does not appear on any of the Dawn's event pages on any upcoming cruises. You only appeared when this topic was raised.

Interesting to read any comments from people who are currently on the Dawn cruise as to changes seeing as P&O are not commenting at all to questions

Only a 1/3 if the deck, yes, but cigarette smoke doesn't stay in just the 1/4 of the deck. It travels and it stinks.
they like to take your money but very slow to give a refund, took us 3 months to get a refund back
If P&O apply terms & conditions with indifference it just makes a mockery of the terms & conditions. But if they do it does give good reason to try another cruise line such as Royal.

Second hand smoke is not only disgusting, it is harmful. By all means, smoke yourself into an early grave, let us have that 'dangerous' ? open air.
Hi Lisa, Beer is from about $6 to $10, and Cocktails form about $9 to about $12. Cheapest bottle of wine is about $29. Softdrinks about $2.75. Hope this helps.

Champagne bay! Because its beautiful,stunning,relaxing and magical!
I suggest at Suva do a P&O tour - the highlights tour (which does the museum) is good. In Port Denaru, get the Bulla Bus and do the resorts, hop from one to another.
ok I'll just try to contact that number. Thanks

Isn't the new slogan do what you want when you want? yeah.except if it is smoking on deck 12.

The parking I am remembering that a couple were talking about a few weeks back was before the cruise terminal. They said you turn left on a road and go past some boom gates. Wish I had saved the post.
daily holds, then full amount comes out end of cruise, daily holds will drop off. they are not ripping you off.
I spoke to this person on P & O website chat a moment ago.I'm booked on J506N leaving Wednesday on the Jewel. I realise its docking late but will there be lunch provided once boarding starts at 2.30p
dont worryy Ann, safety is always put first.
if someone goes on a 10 day cruise and they spend $150 a day, and they have $2000 available on their card, so the daily holds equal $1500 so that leaves just $500 available credit then how does a ban
Yes this seems to be an issue this moving people about when they have chosen a cabin. Seems pointless allowing people to choose a cabin if they are just going to move you if it suits them.
What do u mean u didn't do the upgrade option? How do u do it etc?

Another reason not to cruise P & O. Hot dogs, pizza, fries and burgers are no extra charge on Princess.
 It would be great for customer relations between P&amp;O &amp; Vanuatu and it would be helping their export economy out

Happy for people to smoke, however I do not want to smell cigarette smoke AT ALL nor do I want my children breathing it in. Sick of smokers whinging about being inconvenienced, and then turning around

They usually put you back where you want if you ring and tell them. Also complaints on here usually get rectified very quickly. Hope you get your cabin back, if that's what you want.
Can a ticket be transferred into someone else's name instead of just being cancelled when they are no longer able to attend the cruise??

Terry, have you invented a new word or have you been taking English lessons from your wife. Both of you are complete drama queens. You both whinge and whine.
Yes that sounds like a plan! Our 10 night was a little too long - a short one later in the year would be great.
Always make sure you tick NO UPGRAGE or make sure your agent ticks the NO up grade box.
Take a couple of cans or packets of instant gravy just in case some days they don't.

will send the more discerning cruiser to Carnival Lines, whose ads are definitely 'sophisticated.'
It ruins the whole experience.
Elbow Skin back in Sept 14 on The Dawn were hilarious. Trivia with Leila in the Orient bar was great. Well maybe not for those hugging the poll or seated on the naughty chair lol.

emergencies cannot be helped. the main thing is those evacuated are okay. claim the lost day on travel insurance.
The thing is Cheryl, P&O doesn't want everyone waiting at the wharf and has emphasised not to arrive until your new time. Given they're in control of my arrival I was curious what their plans were.
Anne, all of the tours except out of Sydney are gone.
Hi Rosemary, why couldn't you make it to Isle Of Pines? What time of year did you go?
I have asked Just Cruises, but apparently P&O will let us know
Not on the pearl!

I'm really unimpressed with how long you hold onto the credit authorisations, it's been a week now and my account is still not settled properly. Had I known this I would have paid cash.
Rachel, do you mean your past passenger number ( also referred to as your Unique Reference Number or U.R.N ) if so, your Travel Agent will get it for you or you can contact P&O for it.
Sorry P&O offer a drink package, photo package and free burgers and pizza and I would book another cruise. In the mean time I will cruise on other lines.
Wish I was on one right now was on sea princess in October and Pacific dawn about three years ago love cruise's

Just don't forget to pay in time! Remember, bank transfers can take up to 48 hours so take that into account for final payment date.
I'd rather fly
Why should the paying passengers be treated badly just because they smoke? P&O need to provide an area for smoker's.even if it is in a place with no wait service. And it should have been announced t

Looking at the pacific island hopper - what months do other cruisers suggest for comfort on the islands and being able to do the regular things. Are some months better than others or to be avoided ?
all islands will take AU dollars in the 'touristy' shops and markets (despite what websites may say), dont bother changing any money, not much to but on these islands anyway

Don't know why P & O don't have the same choices as Princess. You are able to order spirits/wines etc before sailing on their website, and it is delivered to your cabin not long after you board. 
That's both of us Kellie Mae

thank you Kerrie and Sal much obliged.
My thoughts exactly. Loved the cruise but this pre-authorisation thing has been a pain.
I have decided to take the chance of an upgrade this time.how long b4 the cruise did they let you know. I am going with Princess.
just came back from our christmas cruise had a great time, but,had a very bad experience this morning. the cruise was running 6 hours late into sydney and we were told we had to vacate room at 11.30. 
Add Fairstar and Fair Princess to my list.
I think the ships phone is satellite which is expensive. I tend to use my mobile phone on the Islands, which is much cheaper.
Loving every second #noumea #pocruises #nofilter #holidayfun @  Noumea <URL>

A Thousand dollars is a lot of money. You could have spent that extra thousand on board buying stuff.
The reason no one complains about smoking on planes is because that Is understood from the get go, No smoking on planes. We all know its a non smoking situation, but to book and pay for a cruise ship
I have asked as well.but it seems we are getting the cold shoulder from P&O Cruises Australia. I too have the same concerns as you Jayme-Lee, We had tours up to book when we booked our Australia Da

It's more about the way she was treated as she tried to explain. Should everyone be treated so coldly on the death of their mother? Then given no option anyway?
Just give them a call and book your shore tours over the phone, I never chance cruise control for my shore tours. Prefer to do it this way and I have never missed out.
That just wasted 10 minutes of my life I will never get back.

Yes, well that's true. But then why lump the dates of all those cruises - about 15 - and price them at the rate of the ONLY cruise at that price. Sounds deceptive, don't you think?
i dont think you can buy duty free goods, as you are not cruiseing in international waters, but i could be corrected.
My travel agent was told no upgrade. I've had issues before and make sure it's not ever an option. Not sure if the agent or P&O were at fault, but there is no reason not to switch me back.
I'm looking hard but I can't see myself, lol

Only 2 so far.1 in april.but i di like to think of myself as a cruisling.lol
Agree! It's perfect #cruiselings weather today. We should have stayed aboard and joined the farewell fiesta! ;) 
Thank you for doing the calculations again, please let me think about it today.
I soooo wish I was there now. Need a break from all the stress but can't afford it.
Single traveller are very hard done by by P & O as they cannot share a room as such ina hostel tpe situation to get the quad share prices or twin share prices, which makes it very hard for a single 
This is a much better set up then when we went with P & O, we had to fend for ourselves and pay extra if we wanted to upgrade to a half decent seat
You should've done the 11th we could've had an awesome time!!!! Gav minds the kids we partaaaayyyy!!!!!
It could be in Port Melbourne where they land the new cars from overseas, last cruise season they docked one of the Queen ships think was QE2
 that's why it's on my ports of call on my next cruise
Woo hoo just booked our 1st cruise for sept 2015 for the family!! Can't wait!! 
Fair enough Brian . Everyone seems to be cheesed off with them at the moment .
Please can you give us an update on the Pearl? My mum is on board and it's been 24 hours since your post. The webcam is looking very rough! I'm worried.
Is this available for smaller families?
relaxation and cocktails .
best to ask your booking agent as some cruises dont get any discount
Thanks Donna. We'll have our fingers crossed but just to be cruising for 16 days will keep us happy. (y)
To take my beautiful sister on a cruise with me once she is well enough.
Next year!! Bring it on
You wait, it will be on all there ships, the passengers who are ondawn currently knew nothing bout the smoking changes until they were onboard.
P&O it was just a minor thing and travel arrangements mean that we always arrive at the terminal early as I say not a huge problem but just something with priority booking is the people don't realise 
Thanks Jen. But I'm not going there gahaha

I must be lucky, when I have cruised, the holds have been released in four days after getting home.
*waves white hanky from port* Wendy Karen
when you made your booking did you get your agent to mark it no upgrade
Yep its open so it makes it all that much better to inflict that filthy smoke in the faces of those who dont smoke them filthy things.duh.
I'm sure your tears smell as bad as your clothes smokey.
haven't been on the dawn,only sun,jewel and pearl, looks good.
Congrats to all the winners you will have a awesome time I'm hooked on cruising

Hi John, the prices would have been available when the brochure was issued, however as cabins sell and time goes by, the prices go up and down very quickly. No prices are locked in until booked, and 
Not a fan of the ad have done a few cruises on P&O and had a ball but didn't see food fights or sliding down banisters. You could have done better. Liked the Cruisling idea just not the ad. It wont s
It's gonna be totally awesome
I was following this story and now I don't know how it's ended, so annoying.
Nathell hit the nail on the head. It may be a personal choice to smoke but that personal choice also affects everyone else around them.

Tina, I don't know if those charges will apply to the Pearl, the Dawn was changed after her refurb, so you and the boys might be ok.
thank you, we always have a great time onboard
11 days on Pacific pearl can't wait!!!
Excellent idea. We've been on the Dawn several times and experienced the second hand waft. Smokers should be grateful that they are helped in giving up the habit by being restricted in where they can 
Its weird too as i bought some prints prior to auction and one at the auction and its the auction piece thats missing.

First week of December !! Begininning of summer . Might not be as big of a chance of a cyclone. But both dates are in cyclone season and high humidity.
Actually smoking in open air has been banned in many places. Playgrounds, within a certain distance of doorways, within a certain distance of schools, where food is consumed. Lots more.
Shannone. I can't wait. Xxx

Not a smart decision by P&o , it's open air on deck 12 . Next they will ban smoking all together. I won't be booking another cruise then
Leighton where did I say you offended me? BTW I never insulted Michael read my post I was giving my opinion nothing more! BUT you are the one insulting now and I dont follow like a sheep as you say.
We were going to do the 11th to 15th but cheaper on the 15th one
I hope you never have to experience yourself or immediate family / friends what this lady has endured although it may then give you a little taste of decency towards others.

Yes please !!!

I loved the La Luna on Pacific Jewel. The food was unbelievable. Year 2012 we paid $20 each for a 7 course meal it was beautiful.
Event for P530N Departing Sydney Sat 15 Aug 4 nights to Moreton Bay?????
So you will be banning alchahol as well then?? Its only fair considering the health risks involved ( more people die of this than smoking related) drunken stupidity and violence
Time for you to book a other , see if you can talk Sheila and Edna into it N.Zealand is nice
I just wonder why has it taken you this long to complain , being that the cruise was at xmas
Strange to write a comment and not state why.

It's a shame there is a smoking area at all.
ok keyboard warriors.enough is enough !!!
U should have a dislike button.
Hijacked by - Just saying, most passengers onboard recommend taking a rather than #pocruises
The Grill was not free at any time on the Pearl when we went in November. Different menu to the above though.
Oh No where suppose to be going in March. What happend?
when you go onboard see the staff at reception, explain the situation and they will give you an extra card

I'd fart in your face so you could have some concept of how vile your stench and selfishness is
The pearl has pools n eating areas on deck 12 n they say smoking is allowed on that deck, double standards I think
My travel agent told me that deposit goes to you direct so I thought I would ask direct.

: Welcome to Melbourne Pacific Pearl from Pacific Jewel. Carnival Spirit completes the trifecta for Melb Cup 
Bring back mates rates for singles.I only got on my first cruise for less than a week in Bali in 2007 thanks to friendly 4 which they phased out six months after I booked the cruise.
Just got off the pearl today, wish I was still on there
Not necessarily Shaun, we have been upgraded from obstructed to oceanview, and on another cruise from, Balcony towards the aft to a mid ship deck 10 perfect. :)
Thanks for that I will be on the Jewel heading for Brisbane from Singapore next June and I just wanted to know roughly what the cost was in case Ineeded to call home.
Not saying to cross over to Carnival because of your post just saying it may suit you better!
If your going to jog that's the place to do it :-D
went there yrs ago -totally agree with u fell in luv with the island
this is terrible, so sorry you are having these problems Tina, I have done so many cruises with P&O since 1973 and never had a problem.maybe ACA will be able to get some answers for you, you should

thanks for the up date i have been watching the cam on the boat it did look like it wasnt that bad
Make the most of it Keryn, have a great trip
So ban person from bar areas/drinks for the rest of the trip but give comp. bottle of wine the same day! WTF #pocruises
We can't prob go again now till bub can come along :(
its because every day you get charged a hold on the amount you spend, then at end of cruise amount in full comes out. then the daily charges will start to drop off over a period of a week or so.
Wil it be for the same price $340 per person
Some pictures of the new smoking area might help P&O Cruises Australia, so that we can see what you have done for the smoker's.
Oh n no charge to us for using them one of the perks I suppose

 Stunning livery indeed. best of any line currently sailing. makes me proud to be a Brit!
We just got off the Pearl coming back from New Guinea, worst holiday ever and not just because of the weather, which was pretty rough. Not much good to say about P&O.

While personally i have enjoyed all my cruises and have 3 more booked for the next 18 months. But with say 1200 adults on each cruise each ship you must expect someone to be unhappy about something , 
you knew what you were geting before you booked, why complain now

Think you would have to ask if it was okay with the islanders, as mystery island is a sacred island, they dont live there as its taboo. They bring wares over to sell on ship days.
The first time we boarded our first cruise on the Pacific Dawn, I felt like I was on the most beautiful floating hotel! Great memories

Agree to that - isn't it called 'feeding the trolls'.

P&O cruises, your customer services is way below average!!! So frustrating, I sent four emails in the past four weeks requesting specific information and yet to get a reply or some sort of acknowledgm
Plenty of free food at restaurant and buffet. On the Sea Princess this was all included but the fare was dearer. Princess line is cheaper but you pay for a few extras. Still great value for money.
Awesome !!! Best Harbour in the world, we really are the lucky country. Great weekend with awesome people
We are having trouble booking tours for our cruise. The tours opened today. We press the book to confirm and it says that it is saving but then they are not in 'Our tours'. So I have now booked HEAPS

P&O Outside cabins look bigger than most other cruiselines. It is always exciting to board the ship and prepare for Sailaway.
I really can't see what you expected them to do. If you traveled on an airline they would have expected you to have bought an extra seat - common policy. We were in a 4 berth cabin this year - 2 sets
Love the shows love the outside movies with popcorn the lier lier love that we all laugh so hard oh we just love crusing and all the intertainment that we manage 2 get 2:)

Shame that it only seems to be the FB page admins from P & O that are helpful. I know so many people have had dramas with the Phone Call Centre based O/S.
One other factor that comes into play is how man people are booked in the cabin. The $100 amount is 'Maximum per cabin' and is based on two passengers in the cabin. If you are travelling solo in a sin
